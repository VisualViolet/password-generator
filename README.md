# Password Generator

## Description

This password generator asks for user input on password parameters and generates a random password that fulfills their selections. I have utilized new JavaScript concepts I have learned in the UW COding Bootcamp, such as functions, arrays, if statements, and prompts to create a working application complete with error handling. Thinking of a random and unique password can be difficult, so why not let an application do all the work for us! In creating this password generator, I have learned how to use basic JavaScript concepts to obtain user input and display interactive feedback!

Students and new developers may also find it beneficial to review the code used to create this application as many of the basic JavaScript concepts are used.
